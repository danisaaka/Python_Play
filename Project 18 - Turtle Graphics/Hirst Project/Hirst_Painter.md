# Explanation
The code starts by importing the necessary modules: Random for color selection and turtle for drawing. It aslo imprts the color_list from the `hirst_main` module

```python
import random
import turtle 
```

#### Import the color_list from the hirst_main module
``` python
from hirst_main import color_list
```

#### Set up the Turtle window
The turtle window is set up with a black background color, and the color mode for the turtle is set to 255 to work with RGB values and a trtle object called `artist` is created to draw

```python
window = turtle.Screen()
window.bgcolor("black")

# Set the color mode to 255 (RGB color values range from 0 to 255)
turtle.colormode(255)

# Create a new turtle object
artist = turtle.Turtle()
artist.speed(0)  # Set the drawing speed (0 is the fastest)

# Define the size and spacing of each dot
dot_size = 20
dot_spacing = 50

# Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns
rows = int(input("Enter the number of rows: "))
columns = int(input("Enter the number of columns: "))
```

```python

# Iterate over each row
for row in range(rows):
# Iterate over each column
for column in range(columns):
# Calculate the position of the dot
x = column * dot_spacing - (dot_spacing * (columns - 1)) / 2
y = row * dot_spacing - (dot_spacing * (rows - 1)) / 2

# Move the artist to the appropriate position
artist.penup()
artist.goto(x, y)
artist.pendown()

# Select a random color for the dot
color = random.choice(color_list)
artist.color(color)

# Draw a dot
artist.dot(dot_size)
```
The division by 2 in the calculation of x and y is to ensure that the dots are centered within the grid.

Let's consider the calculation for x as an example: 
    `x = column * dot_spacing - (dot_spacing * (columns - 1)) / 2`

In this calculation, `(dot_spacing * (columns - 1))` represents the total width of all the columns combined. By dividing it by 2, we are effectively finding half of the total width.

Subtracting `(dot_spacing * (columns - 1)) / 2` from `column * dot_spacing` adjusts the starting position for the dots. This adjustment ensures that when we place the dots, they are centered within the grid horizontally.


The same logic applies to the calculation of y for the vertical positioning of the dots.

By dividing by 2, we account for the extra spacing needed on both sides of the grid, allowing the dots to be evenly distributed within the specified number of rows and columns.

Overall, this adjustment helps in achieving a visually balanced and centered arrangement of dots in the grid.
