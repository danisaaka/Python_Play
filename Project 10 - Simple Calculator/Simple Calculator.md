# Calculator Program

This program is a basic calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic operations on numbers. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Code Explanation

The program consists of several functions and a dictionary that maps operation symbols to their corresponding calculation functions. Here's an overview of the code:

1. The program defines four calculation functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each function takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the corresponding operation.

2. The `operations` dictionary is created, which associates the operation symbols (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) with their respective calculation functions.

3. The `calculator` function is defined. It serves as the main entry point of the program and handles the logic of the calculator.

4. Inside the `calculator` function:
   - It displays the calculator logo or any other relevant information.
   - It prompts the user to enter the first number.
   - It loops through the operation symbols in the `operations` dictionary and prints them.
   - It sets a variable `should_continue` to `True` to control the program flow.

5. The main calculator loop starts with the `while` statement. As long as `should_continue` is `True`, the loop continues executing the following steps:
   - It asks the user to pick an operation symbol.
   - It prompts the user to enter the next number.
   - It retrieves the corresponding calculation function based on the chosen operation symbol.
   - It calls the calculation function with the provided numbers and stores the result in the `answer` variable.
   - It displays the calculated result to the user.
   - It asks the user if they want to continue using the previous result or start a new calculation. If the user chooses to continue, the `num1` variable is updated with the `answer`. Otherwise, the `should_continue` variable is set to `False`, and the program restarts by calling the `calculator` function recursively.

## Usage

To use the calculator program:
1. Make sure you have a Python environment set up.
2. Copy the provided code and save it to a Python file (e.g., `calculator.py`).
3. Run the Python file using your preferred Python interpreter.
4. Follow the prompts to perform calculations by entering numbers and selecting the desired operation symbols.
5. Continue calculating with the previous result or start a new calculation as per the instructions.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs or extend it with additional functionality.
